# GCSO
The Global Car Safety Organisation tests cars for safety and reliability in the event of a crash.
Based upon the weight and speed of the car, the deformation of the car is calculated.

1. Any deformation greater than 180 is considered lethal for the passengers.
2. Any deformation between 80 and 180 is considered average.
3. Deformation below 80 is considered good.
